# Wireshark Packet Analysis

## Overview
In this comprehensive tutorial, we'll delve into the intricate world of Wi-Fi packet analysis using Wireshark. While Wi-Fi is incredibly convenient, its wireless nature introduces security risks, making it a prime target for hackers. Unlike wired networks, Wi-Fi lacks the inherent protection of VLANs and switched networks, rendering it susceptible to unauthorized access. In this tutorial, we'll utilize Wireshark to inspect and analyze packets on a wireless network, gaining deep insights into the traffic flowing through the airwaves.

## Monitor Mode Setup
Before immersing ourselves in Wireshark, it's crucial to set up monitor mode on your wireless adapter. This mode allows you to capture all traffic on a wireless channel without associating with an access point. Here's an in-depth guide on how to do it on a Kali Linux system:

```bash
# Open a command prompt.
$ iwconfig

# Confirm card recognition with airmon-ng.
$ airmon-ng

# Identify and terminate interfering processes.
$ airmon-ng check
$ airmon-ng check kill

# Activate monitor mode.
$ airmon-ng start wlan0

# Confirm the changes.
$ iwconfig
```

## Wireshark Configuration
Now that monitor mode is set up, let's configure Wireshark for effective packet capture and analysis:

```bash
# Open Wireshark.
$ wireshark

# Select the wireless adapter (usually named wlan0mon) for capturing.
# Acknowledge the warning about running Wireshark as a superuser.
# Start capturing by clicking the shark fin icon.
```

## Packet Analysis
With Wireshark capturing packets, let's conduct a detailed analysis of specific frame types:

### 1. Beacon Frames
Beacon frames, as captured in the analysis, serve as periodic transmissions from access points, announcing their presence on the network. Dive into the details to understand the structure and significance of beacon frames.

### 2. Probe Requests and Responses
Explore probe requests and responses to gain insights into how client stations request information from specific access points, including details about supported data rates. Understand the nuances of these exchanges for effective network troubleshooting.

### 3. Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP)
Learn about SSDP, a network protocol for advertising and discovering network services and presence information. Explore its role in modern networks and potential security implications.

### 4. SSID
Dive into the Service Set Identifier (SSID), the primary name associated with a WLAN, and identify networks based on their SSIDs. Understand the importance of secure SSID configurations for robust network security.
