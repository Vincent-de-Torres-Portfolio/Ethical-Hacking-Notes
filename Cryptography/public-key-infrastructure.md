# Exploring Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for Secure Connections

## Introduction

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a robust security architecture designed to ensure the validation and security of data connections between various entities. In this lesson, we will delve into the essential components of PKI, its operational mechanisms, and highlight some well-known certificate authorities. Additionally, we'll explore the critical process of certificate signing, which plays a pivotal role in establishing secure communication.

## Components of PKI

### Certificate Management System

The heart of PKI, the Certificate Management System, orchestrates the entire certificate process. It generates key pairs, manages public and private keys, and ensures the safety of private keys. The public keys are distributed to users, and the system continually verifies key authenticity.

### Digital Certificates

These electronic passwords serve as identity certificates, binding entities to their public keys. They are crucial for validating and securing connections.

### Validation Authority (VA)
The VA verifies the validity of digital certificates using standards like X.509 and RFC 5280. It also stores certificates along with their corresponding public keys.

### Certificate Authority (CA)
The CA issues digital certificates, controlling the entire PKI. It specifies key information, such as organization names and expiration dates. Websites are validated against the CA to ensure authenticity.

### Registration Authority (RA)
The RA acts as the verifier for the CA, often handling certificate registration and validation, particularly in geographically dispersed or resource-intensive scenarios.

### End User
End users are consumers who request, manage, and use certificates. Examples include individuals securing online banking or shopping transactions.

## How PKI Works

PKI can operate automatically or involve user intervention. When a user visits a website, the site may switch to a secure, encrypted mode using PKI.

1. **Certificate Application:**
   - The subject (user, company, or system) applies for a certificate with the RA.

2. **Certificate Issuance:**
   - The RA verifies the subject's identity and requests the CA to issue a public key certificate.

3. **Key Binding:**
   - The CA issues the certificate, binding the subject's identity with their public key. This information is sent to the VA.

4. **User Transaction:**
   - When a user makes a transaction, they sign the information with their public key certificate and send it to the client.

5. **Authentication:**
   - The client verifies the user's authenticity by checking the user's public key with the VA.

6. **Validation:**
   - The VA evaluates the user's public key certificate information from the CA, determining its validity.

To trust a website and enable secure communications via SSL and PKI, keys must come from a trusted source, usually a signed certificate from a reputable CA.

## Common Certificate Authorities

### Comodo
Comodo offers a range of PKI services, including robust SSL encryption with 128- and 256-bit options.

### IdenTrust
IdenTrust provides CA services for various entities, including banks, corporations, governments, and healthcare.

### GoDaddy
GoDaddy offers SSL certificates for businesses and personal sites, providing simple services with a complete range of certificates.

## Certificate Signing

While operating systems can create their PKI, organizations often prefer trusted CAs for security. Signed certificates involve:

1. **Approaching a Trustworthy CA:**
   - Users purchase a digital certificate from a trustworthy CA.

2. **Digital Signing:**
   - Users sign their documents with the public key from the CA.

3. **Verification:**
   - The receiver verifies the certificate through a VA, ensuring its validity.

Self-signed certificates are also an option but are typically used by organizations not customer-facing. Users may receive warnings, and caution is advised.
