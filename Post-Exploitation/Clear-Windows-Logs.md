# Hacker's Tracks Cover-Up

## Disable the Audit Policy (0:29-1:55)

### CMD Directory Table

| Command                            | Description                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `auditpol /get`                    | Retrieve current audit policies                      |
| `auditpol /clear /y`               | Clear and disable all audit policies                 |
| `auditpol /get /category`          | Confirm the successful disabling of all logging      |

When a hacker gains access to a system, one of the initial steps is to disable logging to avoid detection. On Windows, this can be achieved using the `auditpol` tool in PowerShell.

1. Open PowerShell terminal.
2. Retrieve current audit policies: `auditpol /get`.
3. Disable all audit policies: `auditpol /clear /y`.
4. Confirm the disabling: `auditpol /get /category`.

## Delete Event Logs (1:56-2:42)

### CMD Directory Table

| Command                                      | Description                                   |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `Get-EventLog -LogName * | Clear-EventLog`   | Get and clear all event logs using PowerShell |

After disabling the audit policy, the hacker proceeds to delete all logs on the compromised machine. The heavy-handed approach is taken, deleting all logs without a granular distinction.

1. Use PowerShell command: `Get-EventLog -LogName * | Clear-EventLog`.
2. Note: Some logs may not be removed, ensuring a trace of the event remains.

## Current Segment Indicator Summary (2:43-2:54)

In this simulation, we mimicked a hacker's actions after gaining access to a system. The audit logging was disabled, and all traces of actions taken on the compromised machine were deleted. The hacker aimed to cover their tracks and make it challenging to trace any unauthorized activities.
